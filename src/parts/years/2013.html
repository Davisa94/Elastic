<p class="display-4 pl-5 2013">A year later passes and Jordan Sterling (From Obscure) helps them record a larger EP called 'Material' featuring a dog toy in the shape of a pig as the artwork.</p>
<p class="display-4 pl-5 2013">Here, the tracks from Misplaced Pieces are completely re-recorded, replacing Steve the Drum Machine with Nick Grands humanized sound as well as all of Walter's old vocals and electric guitar tracks, and Thomas' bass guitar tracks from using Walt's Old Fender5 and Nick's New Fender4 bass to Thomas' favorite Warwick Thumb.</p>
<p class="display-4 pl-5 2013">Here, the song 'Another Dream' makes its only appearance (played live only twice) & 'Seedless' made its debut, as well as the cult classic Conscripted Youth cover 'Leather & Plaid' which gets local legends such as Bren Dube (Letterbomb) and Cody King (The Dateless Losers, Watering Hole) for backup vocals on the track, as well as Elastic's first songs that Thomas would 'sing' lead roles in.</p>
