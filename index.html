        -
        ( A semi brief story on what is elastic and how it came to be )
        
        
        12 years ago , Walter Staley (from The Grotesque, Burn This River, We Sleep At Dawn, The Paradigm Shift) (Vocals, Lyric Writing, Song Writing, Electric Guitar) and Thomas Ayres (From Catch 21, Conscripted Youth, We Sleep At Dawn, Lamp, NoiseBleed) (Backup Vocals, Song Writing, Bass Guitar) forms a band of extreme elasticity and robustness.
        Stretching the possibilities of Post-Rock and Grunge ( From influences such as The Melvins, Nirvana, Three Days Grace, Pearl Jam & The Offspring), with nuances of Noise Rock and heavier alternative rhythms ( with other influences like Melt Banana, The Locust, Korn, Mudvayne, Alice in Chains, Dead Cross, Retox, Tool, Deftones & Primus ). Moments later the band is named Elastic and then Walters and Thomas' life as roommates also begins and the writing doesn't seem to end.
        
        Weeks later we recorded and released our 1st Demo (Misplaced Pieces)
        containing earlier renditions of the tracks 'Breaking', 'Flying', 'Complexity of the Being', 'No Tomorrow' & 'Staring at the Sun' and Steve the drum machine (programmed by Walt) makes its debut on drums.
        After a few months they joined forces with local shredder Nick Grand (From bands like Letterbomb, We Sleep At Dawn, Lamp, Watering Hole, Just Right) who lends Elastic his place for jams to help make a 3 piece. The band then plays a handful of hometown shows and cements its lineup for years to come.
        
        A year later passes and Jordan Sterling (From Obscure) helps them record a larger EP called ' Material ' featuring a dog toy in the shape of a pig as the artwork.
        Here the tracks from Misplaced Pieces are completely re-recorded, replacing Steve the Drum Machine with Nick Grands humanized sound as well as
        all of Walters old vocals and electric guitar tracks, and Thomas' bass guitar tracks from using Walt's Old Fender5 and Nick's New Fender4
        bass to Thomas' favorite Warwick Thumb. Here the song 'Another Dream' makes it's only appearance (played live only twice) & 'Seedless' made its debut, as well as the cult classic Conscripted Youth cover 'Leather & Plaid' which get local legends such as Bren Dube (Letterbomb) and Cody King (The Dateless Losers, Watering Hole) for backup vocals on the track as well as Elastic's first songs that Thomas would 'sing' lead roles in.
        
        Another year passes, more songs are written, more shows are played, and a booking with Siegfried Meier of Beach Road Studios is made.
        After a successful year of Walter's investment in 'bitcoin', we where able to afford a 5 star recording and went to the best recording studio
        in Canada. With songs such as our first big Rock single 'Anomaly', Our heavy Tool-esque neck buster 'Forever Asleep', A Rock anthem 'Purged', The Fuzzy yet funky
        'Here Without You', and the angst filled 'Suicociety' and heavy slugger 'Termites' finally dipping their heads above the water and making
        an appearance on an album after playing such songs live for about a year prior.
        
        After several years with Nick Grand on drums, Walter and Thomas parted ways with him after some internal battles involving passion, feelings, confusion and frustration.
        
        A few months after the split with Nick, John O'Rourke & Josh Gyssels (both from the band SoundSystem, JG from The Tyranny) lends help to elastic's next EP, 'From Out of the Darkness'.
        With John lending vocal harmonies and acoustic guitar tracks' as well as Josh' percussion ability being displayed on every song, the EP has a warm but full feel of expressive emotions but without the heaviness of the amps in play. (Sinner, Lost & Found being the albums new power ballads and a acoustic rendition of Breaking & Complexity of the Being making its way on the EP as well.)
        This is also where Chase Mcleay makes his first appearance on an album, and month's later becomes a permanent member of the band for the current live and studio album lineup as a 2nd 6 string Guitarist and vocal harmonist. (And later on Synth user. )
        
        
        As well as coming across Chase Mcleay, months later he was able to bring along his friend Nuno Machado who played drums and had a local jam space in Chatham that lend help to elastic being a live performing band again (Both previously of the band NoiseBleed & Schizo? and now Nuno resides in the Give N Goes).
        
        Contact with a local legend was made for another full length Elastic album 'Weirdsville' after we loved how he made our acoustic EP sound and how he good he got Anu Beginning's recent release at the time to sound , we went
        to see how he could make us sound re-amped up. Erik Gurney fully delivered in both situations and for only a fraction that we had to pay up at Beach Road Studios (No dis to any studio, we just didn't have the extra thousands this time around).
        
        In this album you could also hear Thomas' Theremin work, as well as his bass pedal board of doom in full motion. (Ultra Glue and the end Of Complexity of the Being you can hear the monster quite a bit in, unfortunately the theremin got destroyed a year later after a few too many 'excited' & 'rowdy' crowds where exposed to the fragile demon of sonic arts, as well as half of Thomas' Bass pedals being stolen from random shows/ burned down in a house fire, as well as stolen out of a friends car. (Lots of bad luck for Thomas that year)
        As well as Nuno's double bass and monstrous ability at drums being showed off in almost every song. (The bass and drum work in 'Null & Void, This Is The End & No Son' are good examples here.) As well as fretless bass on the track 'Hapathy' made from a bass handed down from local bass playing friend Mike Reeshe then hand sanded down by Thomas and his father filling in the fret gaps with boat fibre glass to help smoothen the sound.
        
        In Weirdsville you are able to hear other tracks make their first time appearance in the limelight such as the menacing stoner-prog-masterpiece that is 'Null & Void' or the happy sad Grunge Anthem of 2018- 'Hapathy'. Even the track' This Is the End' holds much fierce energy with progressive fun parts and a rippin bass solo. ' A Primus cover' Too Many Puppies ' also makes its way on this album as a curveball towards the end. The tracks 'Complexity of the Being' 'UltraGlue' & ' No Tomorrow ' also get a proper final rework and rerecording of maximized effectiveness. And the old timey vibe ' No Son ' also made its way in the album as well.
        
        Several year's pass by, Global Lockdown occurs then lingers and live playing becomes scarce for musicians everywhere, Walter Staley writes over 20 songs over these years, and
        after 500 days of the band being on hiatus, we got back together, but this time at a place we call 'Uncle Steve's Studio' also known as 'Sound & Music' over in Wallaceburg, Chase' Uncle single handily (maybe both hands) saves our band from not having a jam space again. We get back to practising and jamming every month. Walter and Thomas work together on a few cover singles such as Nirvanas' Something in the Way' and teamed up with NerfGunner (J.O) again for Deftones' 'Passenger' and they got released as we where getting studio time scheduled again months before playing the recently filmed Rye Field Studios set up north (All on youtube in 4k).
        
        Nuno's time with the band comes closer to end and we have to find another drummer, Josh Gyssels lends help on the ruthlessly raw & upbeat track ' Hold On ' with his drumming skills, (and Chase's first time getting his synth onto a studio track.)
        helps fill in for drums at a show we play at a local skate park.
        
        Nuno offers his help with 2 more 'final Nuno shows' for a proper farewell. We may regroup with him 10 or 20 years from now, but not for a while as he has many other bands
        and endeavors to take care of and be proud of.
        
        Weeks later, we come across a local open mic drummer enthusiast 'Cameron Hackett' who loves bands such as 'Animals as Leaders' 'Dream Theatre' & 'X Japan' and enjoys drummers such as Matt Garstka, Mike Portnoy, Jeff Porcaro, Matt Halpern, John Bonham & Forest Rice to name a few. His ability to name off drum techniques, and drummers in split seconds and show off the chops was quite a welcomed sight to see.
        He has came to several practices and rehearsals now, and has agreed to drum on our next single, as well as play shows with us in the upcoming future.
        
        -- AND HERE WE ARE NOW -- 12 years after the beginning.
        
        We are currently working on a large batch of songs, most which have a similar story and vibe, which will be in the next full length album. (We already have the entire pre-prod recorded which took place over the past 14 months, approx. 13 tracks! )
        However some songs don't fit in the albums lore so we will be releasing them earlier as singles.
